# Schrödinger's Chicken

![Chicken](icon.svg)

A chicken and a quantum superposition.

This is named after
[Schrödinger's Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat), a
famous thought experiment created by an annoyed scientist to show the absurdity
of quantum superposition.

Currently mucking about in
[Godot 4 beta 5](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-5).
